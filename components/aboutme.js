                <a className="">Hi! I’m Collins Maglasang, a computer engineering student who enjoys creating apps and exploring new technologies. Most of my projects so far have focused on frontend development, and I love building clean, interactive interfaces that are easy for people to use.
                            Recently, through our capstone project, I’ve been learning more about connecting hardware with software — working with Bluetooth devices and moving data between sensors and apps. It’s been exciting to see how the app interacts with real-world devices and how the frontend connects with live data. I enjoy tackling these challenges, experimenting with new technologies, and learning as I go.
                            Outside of coding, I like staying active and exploring hobbies that keep me creative and energized. My goal is to keep growing as a developer, build projects I’m proud of, and keep learning new ways to make apps both functional and user-friendly.</a>
